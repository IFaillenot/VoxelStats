This program will let you run voxelwise generalized linear modeling with MINC2 file type. This program is inspired by Jason Lerch's RMINC and Keith Worsley's SurfStats toolboxes and compliments those packages with adding support for adding voxelwise predicting variables. 

Currently this is distributed under GNU public license with no warranty but I would love to support for an issue as my time permits. Please acknowledge this repository in your documents. 
This utilizes any parellel profiles setup in your MATLAB.
